Hi,
this is source code for an Android app I have wrote ten years ago when I had 1 year of commercial experience.
You can find it in Google Play under ["Choir Buddy"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.waw.echo.choirbuddy).

I have learned all the Android related things by myself using only the documentation.
I have 10 more years of software programming under my belt so I hope this is enough to prove I can code.

Cheers.
